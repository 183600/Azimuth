    • No instance for ‘Show (MVar Double)’
        arising from the second field of ‘Metric’ (type ‘MVar Double’)
      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Show Metric)
