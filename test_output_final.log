    • Ambiguous type variable ‘t0’ arising from a use of ‘property’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Arbitrary t0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘t0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance (Arbitrary a, Arbitrary b) => Arbitrary (Either a b)
          -- Defined in ‘Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary’
        instance Arbitrary Ordering
          -- Defined in ‘Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary’
        ...plus 21 others
        ...plus 94 instances involving out-of-scope types
